# Welcome to the Mazuri mod!

## Multiplayer Currency

So basically I wanted to make a mod where diamonds are not the default multiplayer currency , but still indirectly used via the Mazuri Coins...

## Not Farmable

This mod aims at making the coins only available by mining, thus the use of the ores in the recipes and  not the ingots (mostly farmable)

## N.B!
This is my first try at a mod... I am still fairly new to java and coding in general.
Feel free to indicate any better ways I could've done things. Thanks for your time!
