# Welcome to the Mazuri mod!

## Multiplayer Currency

So basically I wanted to make a mod where diamonds are not the default multiplayer currency (still indirectly used via the Mazuri Coins...)

## Not Farmable

This mod aims at making the coins only available by mining, thus the use of the ores in the recipes and  not the ingots (mostly farmable)

## P.s!
This is my first try at modding... I am still fairly new to java and coding in general.
Feel free to indicate any better ways I could've done things...
